# Weather-Dashboard

Weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS and built to display the current weather in a city of choice with (5) days forecast.

# Description
Weather-Dashboard is an application to find a weather condition of a given city both  current and 5-Days and these data includes:

* City
* Humidity
* Temperature
* Wind
* UV %

## Challenges
I had a problem configuring the github pages with the submited files but at the end I was able to fix it.
If the Open Weather Map fails to find a city that matches what the user typed, no feedback is provided to the user. 

## User Story

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
